# Google Homepage Project

This is a [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) challenge.  

The goal is to recreate the appearence of a google homepage using HTML and CSS.

I have used float for the header nav bar, [flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) for the two search buttons and this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-keep-your-footer-where-it-belongs-59c6aa05c59c/) for the sticky footer.
